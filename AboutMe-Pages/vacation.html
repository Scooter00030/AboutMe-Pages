		<p>Well there are many places that I would love to visit and explore, but traveling cost a lot of money that I currently do not have. So here are the places that make me go OHHHH AHHHH, lets go there now!! For now they are just dreams soon to be realities.</p>
		<p> <b>Great Barrier Reef</b></p>
			<p>While we are on Bucketlist items, I would love to get my scuba diving license and dive in the largest coral reef in the world.</p>

		<p>Next on the list is St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. This place looks absolutely breathtaking and I just so happen to be able to visit this place come February 2017, so we can go ahead and cross off this one at that time.</p>
